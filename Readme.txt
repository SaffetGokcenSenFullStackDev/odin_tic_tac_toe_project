This is a project in the full-stack Javascript path of the Odin Project. A tic 
tac toe game that can be played in browsers is to be made. The aim of the 
project is to exercise on the scope concept, the closure concept, the factory 
functions, the module pattern and the prototype based object oriented programming. 

To cancel a move, click on that move again. To complete a move, click on the 
"Change player" button. The program does not let a player to make disallowed 
moves.
